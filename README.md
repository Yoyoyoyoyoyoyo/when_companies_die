Creating a model for use in an API that will give probabilities that a company will go out of business

This uses https://github.com/Yoyoyoyoyoyoyo/lifespan_of_companies as a starting point, but uses a proportional hazards model instead of an elastic net model. It may or may not end with a functional API based on the model's results.
